O<spindle_warm_up> sub

(Macro to warm up the spindle prior to cutting)
(Input your own "Safe" location for where the spindle can go through this cycle in <_SafeX> and <_SafeY>)
(Input a safe Z travel height to avoid anything in your workspace with <_TravelZ>)
(Machine will rapid to your safe travel Z height, and then will rapid to your "safe" location)
(The code will start the spindle at 8K rpm and increases by 2k every 60 seconds)
(There aren't any fail safes for making sure you have a tool that can handle the max 24K RPM)

(!!!!  Use at your own risk following your own safety precautions  !!!!)

#<SafeX> =           16        ( Machine ABS X coordinate where spindle can safely warm up )
#<SafeY> =           25        ( Machine ABS Y coordinate where spindle can safely warm up )
#<TravelZ> =         -.25      ( machine ABS Z coordinate for travelling, typically near max Z to avoid ever hitting the work )
